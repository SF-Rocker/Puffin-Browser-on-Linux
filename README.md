# Puffin Browser on Linux - Unofficial guide to installing Puffin Internet Terminal on Linux
_Note: for **Windows** the browser is called **Puffin Secure Browser** or simply **Puffin Browser**, for **Linux** the browser is called **Puffin Internet Terminal**. Initially **Puffin Internet Terminal** is intended for **Raspberry Pi** devices, but this does not prevent it from being installed on a regular Debian-based computer.
You can still use the Chromium or Firefox browsers but the performance is barely acceptable, on Raspberry Pi devices or if you have a very low Internet speed, and a very low-end device._

**Puffin Internet Terminal** is a fast functional browser for low end PCs and laptops. Puffin Internet Terminal provides fast page loading with **cloud-based content compression technology** and **saves traffic**.

## Why is this repository created for?
Cloudmosa has not released their official Debian repositories, so I have created this repository to make Puffin more accessible to the Linux community.

**Benefits**:
- Cloud-based content compression technology with saving and encrypts traffic, because of this, the browser works very quickly and does not use much RAM
- Supports working with cloud storage.
- Own ads blocker, works with 97% efficiency
- Pretty cheap price, just $2 a month, first month for free*
- ~~Support for Adobe Flash technology (no longer in demand).~~

**Disadvantages**:
- Based on old version of Chromium engine, because of this, some sites refuse to working.
- No support for DRM and browser extensions

# Installation:
*For RaspberryPI we recommend to use `Pi-Apps` store: https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps*

**WARNING: arm\* versions of Puffin are basically RaspberryPI only and require some special dependencies.**

## "I have an X distribution, with another package manager instead of apt".
You need to extract the deb files and try to run the executable. Unfortunately I can't guarantee a result.

## Run:
- Full version
```
puffin
```
- Demo version*
```
puffin_demo
```

## Demo VS Full version:
The demo version is fully functional as the paid version, but does not require a subscription.
